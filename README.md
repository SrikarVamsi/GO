🤝 Make Group Hangouts Easy and Fun!

Do you have a group of friends with different tastes and preferences when going out? It can be tough to decide where to go and what to do when everyone has different interests. Hangout Matchmaker solves this problem by helping a group of friends find the perfect match for their hangout plans!

🚀 The Goal

Our goal is simple: to help users plan hangouts that work for everyone. We aim to match a user with 3-4 friends, considering everyone's unique preferences, and suggest an activity or location that balances those preferences.

🧠 How It Works

Input Preferences: Each friend provides their preferences (e.g., types of food, budget, activities, or time availability).

Algorithm Magic ✨: Our system processes the data and finds a balanced solution that meets the needs of everyone in the group.

Perfect Match: The user receives the ideal hangout suggestion that works for all!

🛠 Key Features

User-friendly Input: Simple interface for users to enter and modify their preferences.
Smart Matching: Intelligent algorithm that finds the best compromise between friends' preferences.
Real-time Suggestions: Get a result in seconds with a recommendation that works for everyone.
Customizable Settings: Choose between food, activity, or location as the primary factor.

🧪 Testing

The company will run the tool with a variety of test data and scenarios, ensuring that our solution works even with conflicting preferences. Expect comprehensive tests with different group sizes, preferences, and hangout types.

📊 Example Use Case
Imagine this:

Friend A: Loves sushi 🍣, prefers evenings, has a moderate budget.
Friend B: Likes pizza 🍕, prefers weekends, low budget.
Friend C: Loves hiking 🏞, prefers afternoons, flexible budget.
Our app will suggest a fun activity or a nearby restaurant that can cater to everyone's needs. Maybe an outdoor pizza and sushi picnic at a scenic spot? 🧺🍕🍣

🔧 Future Plans

Dynamic Suggestions: Add real-time data like current weather and trending events to influence suggestions.
Expanded Preferences: Allow users to rank preferences by importance.
Friend Groups: Save groups of friends for future hangout planning.
