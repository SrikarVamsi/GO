## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Swift (iOS)
- **Backend (Future)**: Aiming for Firebase (SDK issues slowed down implementation due to *climatic conditions* 🌧️).

I *tried* to build both frontend and backend, but let's be real, making an app in **48 hours** from scratch is a feat itself! 😂 For now, it's a fully functional UI with all navigations set. The backend will come soon—when the weather and time are on my side! 🌪️

## 🎨 The Orange-Red Theme (Why? 🤔)

You might be wondering, *Why did you choose orange-red as the theme?* Well, let me tell you:

- **Red** symbolizes *passion and excitement*—because who isn't excited about hanging out with friends?
- **Orange** stands for *creativity and enthusiasm*—and let's face it, we need a LOT of creativity when figuring out everyone's preferences!

Together, they represent the fiery energy of GO, making planning fun and easy. Or maybe I just like the colors… who knows? 😂

## 💡 Future Plans

While the UI is set, there’s plenty more to be done:
1. **Implement Firebase for Authentication and Chat**: Connect users and let them chat within the app (pending that climate improves, of course 😅).
2. **Stable Matching & Matchmaking Algorithms**: I'll be diving into constraint satisfaction algorithms like Stable Matching, along with some Weighted Matching algorithms. These algorithms will help automate the planning process by efficiently balancing preferences.
3. **Reservation System**: Backend integration with a reservation service API for seamless booking based on user preferences.
4. **Better Group Dynamics**: Add advanced algorithms for group decision-making and suggestions based on complex preference weights.

## 🚀 How I Built This (Spoiler: It Was an Adventure!)

This is my very first Swift-based iOS app! I'm not typically the tech person in my teams, but I love a challenge. Usually, I focus on **Product Management, UI/UX, and pitching**, but I took on Swift, design, and backend (in theory) for this project. With more time (and fewer SDK download issues!), I’d connect Firebase for user data, chat, and more.

## 🤝 Contributions & Improvements
If you’d like make suggestions for improving the UI/UX or backend, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue. Since this was built solo in 48 hours, I'm open to all kinds of criticism!

---

## 📈 Status & What’s Next
The app is in its **early stage** (UI-only). With more time and a team, we’d easily connect it to Firebase and implement complex planning algorithms.

## 🎉 Special Thanks
Thanks to the opportunity that pushed me out of my comfort zone, and a shoutout to the climate that delayed my backend progress! This was fun, and I’m excited to keep building on it.
